**Key Nutritional Considerations:**
- Entirely gluten-free meal plan
- High protein content for muscle recovery
- Complex carbohydrates for sustained energy
- Balanced fat intake from healthy sources
- Nutrient-dense foods supporting ultra-marathon performance

**Hydration:** Recommended 3-4 liters of water throughout the day, with electrolyte supplementation during training.

**Performance Notes:**
- Meal timing supports training energy needs
- Protein distributed across meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis
- Carbohydrates strategically placed around training sessions
