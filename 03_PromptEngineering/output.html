Lightweight, High-Calorie Foods:
1. Dehydrated/Freeze-Dried Options
- Quinoa
- Chia seeds
- Dried lean meats
- Powdered egg whites
- Nuts (almonds, macadamia)

Nutrient-Dense Supplements:
- Whey protein isolate
- MCT oil powder
- Electrolyte tablets
- Compact multivitamin

Calorie Calculations:
- Estimated Base Metabolic Rate: ~1,800 calories
- Ultra-marathon training additional needs: +1,500-2,000 calories
- Total Daily Requirement: ~3,300-3,800 calories

Recommended Macro Breakdown:
- Protein: 25% (206-238g)
- Fats: 40% (146-168g)
- Carbohydrates: 35% (288-332g)

Practical Packing Strategy:
- Vacuum-sealed packages
- Minimal water weight
- High energy-to-weight ratio
- Vacuum-sealed for preservation

This approach maximizes nutritional density while minimizing weight and volume.</pre></td>
