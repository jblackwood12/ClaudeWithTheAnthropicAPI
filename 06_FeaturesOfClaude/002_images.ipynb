    "   - Typical residential features (driveway connection, regular geometry)\n",
    "   - Distinction from other structures (garages, sheds, pools)\n",

    "   - Areas where branches create a \"bridge\" between wildland vegetation and the structure\n",

    "   - Identify if trees connect to form a continuous canopy over or near the home\n",
    "   - Note any obvious fuel ladders (vegetation that can carry fire from ground to tree to roof)\n",

    "5. Fire risk rating: Based on your analysis, assign a Fire Risk Rating from 1-4:\n",
    "   - Rating 1 (Low Risk): No tree branches overhanging the roof, good defensible space around the structure\n",
    "   - Rating 2 (Moderate Risk): Minimal overhang (<25% of roof), some separation between tree canopies\n",
    "   - Rating 3 (High Risk): Significant overhang (25-50% of roof), connected tree canopies, multiple points of vulnerability\n",
    "   - Rating 4 (Severe Risk): Extensive overhang (>50% of roof), dense vegetation against structure, numerous ember catch points, limited defensible space\n",
